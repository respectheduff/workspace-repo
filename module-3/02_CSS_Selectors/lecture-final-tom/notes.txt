HTML5 & CSS3 

Block Elements (start on new line, take up full width)
p, div, form, header, footer, h1-h6

Inline Elements (don't start on new line, only as much width as needed)
a, span, img
* accept margin & padding
* ignore height & width

Inline-Block (basically inline, but you can set height & width)
